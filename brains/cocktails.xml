        <description>
            An apple martini (appletini for short) is a cocktail containing vodka and one or more of apple juice, apple cider, apple liqueur, or apple brandy.
            Optionally, vermouth may be included, as in a regular martini.
            Typically, the apple vodka is shaken or stirred with a sweet and sour mix and then strained into a cocktail glass.
            The appletini is a variation of the vodka martini, which diverges in taste from the typical dry martini by adding apple juice and/or apple liqueur, or apple schnapps.
            It tends to be served in the standard martini glass, but truly differs from the martini in taste, since it is a fruity tasting drink with the apple flavor usually masking the vodka.

            This drink, properly called an Adam's Apple Martini, was created and popularized in 1997 by Adam Karsten, a bartender at Lola's in West Hollywood, California.
            The appletini is the favorite alcoholic drink of John "J.D." Dorian in the sitcom Scrubs in which it is often characterized as being somewhat effeminate.
            Along with a rum and diet coke, it is also the favorite drink of Alan Harper from Two and a Half Men.
            In the 2010 film The Social Network, in the initial meeting between Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin and Napster co-founder Sean Parker, Parker buys the table a few rounds of the drink.
            In real life, Zuckerberg never had an appletini until he attended the film's premiere.
            After seeing the film, Zuckerberg made the appletini Facebook's official drink.

            The appletini was anything but bright green, instead it was a very light sage green.
            I love Granny Smith apples and this tastes like that.
            Nice clean apple flavor.
            If you love the apple flavored jolly rancher and the smell than this is the juice you should get.
            I keep thinking I am eating green apple jolly rancher it is amazing.
            If you love fruit and want to taste apple, this is the one for you!
            This juice has a nice apple flavor, but not overwhelming with just a hint of vodka.
            Tastes like a nice, fresh green apple right out of the fridge.
            There's no noticeable tartness to this.
            If you are looking for a crisp, refreshing, sweet and slightly tangy apple flavor -- look no further.

            It is a sweet cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice.
            It may be garnished with a pineapple wedge, a maraschino cherry, or both.
            You don't have to go to the tropics to enjoy a smooth, sweet coconut flavor.
            Instead, you can enjoy it from the comfort of your own home with our Pina Colada flavor.
            Just like your favorite tropical beverage, the Pina Colada has a smooth, rather subdued taste, making it perfect for everyday use.

        <history>
            The Pina Colada has roots that can be traced to Puerto Rico and has long been considered the island Country's national drink.
            The cocktail was said to be invented by a bartender at the luxurious Caribe Hilton Hotel's Beachcomber Bar in 1952 shortly after a key ingredient, Coco Lopez cream of coconut, was developed.
            Puerto Rico honors the cocktail with a National Pina Colada Day that is celebrated each year on July 10th.

            The name pina colada literally means "strained pineapple", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation.
            The earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, to boost his crew's morale, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple and white rum.
            This was what would be later known as the famous pina colada.
            With his death in 1825, the recipe for the pina colada was lost.
            The pina colada has been the national drink of Puerto Rico since 1978.

            classic tropical cocktail with rum, pineapple and coconut milk.
            This classic recipe will transport you to paradise.
            What I have in mind is the sort of weekend where you go to a nice, exotic location -- preferably one with a beach -- and relax with a tall, cool, refreshing drink (and forget about the rest of the world).
            Although the rum adds a wonderful subflavor to this drink, it's really the flavors of the pineapple and coconut cream that dominate.
            Often when we're on vacation (at some exotic destination or on a cruise)
            Must be because it's so pretty and such a smooth drink.
            makes me want to go the beach hang out and enjoy one right now.
            Ooh yummy I love pina coladas during the summer by the pool!
            I'm ready for a tropical vacation! Or maybe just a pina colada on a relaxing evening at home. :)
            I think I need to make this and bring back those happy memories of fun and sun
            Haha I wasn't aware it's quite high calorie though.
            this is kind of a caloric drink

    <cocktail name="Long Island Iced Tea">
        <prime>tequila, gin, rum, vodka, triple sec</prime>
        <description>
            A Long Island Iced Tea is a type of alcoholic mixed drink typically made with, among other ingredients, tequila, vodka, light rum, triple sec, and gin.
            It is so named because of the resemblance to the color and taste of iced tea.
            A popular version mixes equal parts vodka, gin, tequila, rum, and triple sec with 1.5 parts sour mix and a splash of cola, which gives the drink the same amber hue as its namesake.
            Most variants use equal parts of the main liquors, but include a smaller amount of triple sec (or other orange-flavored liqueur).
            Close variants often replace the sour mix with lemon juice, replace the cola with diet cola or actual iced tea, or add white crème de menthe; however, most variants do not include any tea.
        </description>
        <history>
            There is some dispute as to the origin of the Long Island Iced Tea.
            However, numerous sources attribute the origin to one or both of two inventors in the 1920s or 1970s.
            The Long Island Iced Tea appears in literature as early as 1961.
            Robert "Rosebud" Butt claims to have invented the drink as an entry in a contest to create a new mixed drink including Triple Sec, in 1972 while he worked at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, NY.
            Various local New York references echo Butt's claims.
            Local rumors also ascribe the origin to either Butt or another bartender at the Oak Beach Inn, Chris Bendicksen.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            Some restaurants substitute brandy for the tequila.
            Some variants of the drink have alternative names such as Texas Iced Tea, Georgia Iced Tea, Tokyo Tea, Three Mile Island, and Adios Mother Fucker.
            The drink has a much higher alcohol concentration (approximately 22 percent) than most highball drinks due to the relatively small amount of mixer.
            Long islands can be ordered "extra long", which further increases the alcohol to mixer ratio.
        </trivia>
        <comments>
            Most Long Island Iced Teas contain over two-ounces of mixed spirits, making them relatively potent drink.
            Although half-ounce liquor portions may seem small, they have a significant cumulative affect.
            It's a stealth drink.
            It goes down so easy, the high alcohol content sneaks up on you.
            It's also a great pre-mixer to make in pitchers and serve at parties.
            Summertime is an ideal time to serve the Long Island Iced Tea, because its taste is reminiscent of iced tea even though there's no tea in it at all.
            The drink also shares a similar taste to tea.
            i think it tastes like artificially sweetened tea beverage ie: nestea or something like that
            it tastes like very sweet ice tea made from a mix served in cheap bars and diners
            taste like non-alcoholic iced tea

    <cocktail name="Californication">
        <prime>vodka, gin, rum, tequila</prime>
        <description>
            Not to be outdone, California has put its own twist on the Long Island Iced Tea with the creation of the Californication, the golden state variation of the popular Long Island cocktail.
            The Californication is a mixture of rum, vodka, tequila and gin finished with orange liqueur, lemon juice and orange juice to taste.
            Strong but sweet.
            The mixed drink is finished with either a piece of orange or a twisted peel of orange rind.
            The Californication is not a subtle cocktail, but the citrus flavor imparted by the orange liqueur and orange juice attempt to disguise the punch it packs from the mixture of spirits.
            The name of the cocktail, Californication, is based on a term that is prominent in the lyrics of a song by the rock group, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
            There has also been a television series that has run since August 2007 with the same name.

    <cocktail name="Margarita">
        <prime>tequila</prime>
        <description>
            The Margarita gets lots of love in the US.
            Partly that's because of its slightly sour -- but wonderful and refreshing -- lime taste.
            And partly it's because the drink has become synonymous with a carefree, easy-going lifestyle.
            The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice (straight up).
            Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in the eponymous margarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe somewhat resembling an inverted sombrero.
        </description>
        <history>
            One of the earliest stories is of the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos "Danny" Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Mexico, created for customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits, but not to tequila.
            A commonly accepted origin story of the Margarita is that it was invented in October 1941, at Hussong's Cantina in Ensenada, Mexico, by bartender Don Carlos Orozco.
            One afternoon, Margarita Henkel, the daughter of the then German ambassador visited the cantina and Don Carlos who had been experimenting with drinks offered her one.
            The cocktail consisted of equal parts of tequila, Mexican orange liqueur called Controy (A.K.A. Naranja in the United States), and lime, shaken and served over ice in a salt-rimmed glass.
            As she was the first to try the drink, Don Carlos decided to name it after her and the "Margarita" was born.
            A little additional sweetness helps to balance out the recipe and bridges the gap between classic and lime slushy.

            You know, as in Jimmy Buffett's song, Margaritaville.
            The most important ingredient for this drink is tequila.
            You want to use something decent, but not overly fancy.
            a cocktail consisting of tequila, triple sec (such as Cointreau) and lime or lemon juice, often served with salt on the rim of the glass.
            But one thing is clear: the Margarita is basically a "sour," like the Whiskey Sour, the Sidecar, and the Classic Daiquiri.
            All these drinks are made with liquor + citrus (lemon or lime) + something sweet to temper the sourness of the citrus (simple syrup or triple sec).
            I find it works better with the lime's tartness and gives a smoothness to the Margarita.

            The simplest example is the balance of sweet and sour.
            Since it's such a well known, and simple, cocktail you'd think getting a decent Margarita would be easy.
            The Margarita recipe is one of the easier cocktail recipes, and can be considered a "base cocktail".
            Traditional margaritas are served over ice with a salty rim, but some people like them frozen, it gives it a slightly sweeter, less potent taste.
            They are sweet and tangy.
            A traditional margarita is made with lime juice and is sweetened, often with sour mix.
            Tequila is the alcohol and it does have a very strong taste.
            It's salty and super yummy!
            One of the properties of crystalline fructose is that it causes a cooling sensation on the tongue when the crystals melt.
            Fresh squeezed lime juice is a must, period, end of story.
            Unless you commit to that, you'll never be able to produce a truly great Margarita.
            The Margarita is about balance, and should not taste like a "salt lick" found on a farm.
            If you still find that too salty, try mixing it with a bit of sugar or, better yet, fructose.
            Just another level of refreshing.

    <cocktail name="Caipirinha">
        <prime>cachaca</prime>
        <description>
            is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaca (sugar cane hard liquor), sugar and lime.
            Cachaca is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage (also known as Pinga or Caninha).
            Although both rum and cachaca are made from sugarcane derived products, specifically in cachaca, the alcohol results from the fermentation of fresh sugarcane juice that is afterwards distilled, while rum is usually made from by-products from refineries, such as molasses.
        </description>
        <history>
            Although the real origin of caipirinha as we know it today is unknown, according to one account it began around 1918 in the state of Sao Paulo with a popular recipe made with lime, garlic and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu.
            As it was quite common to add some distilled spirits to home remedies in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, rum was commonly used.
            Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            The caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil, and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country.
            Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink has become more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cachaca outside Brazil.
            The word caipirinha is the diminutive version of the word caipira, which refers to someone from the countryside, being an almost exact equivalent of the American English hillbilly or the Lowland Scots teuchter.
            The word may be used as either a masculine or a feminine noun, but when referring to this drink it is only feminine (usage of diminutives is common in Brazil).
            In the Brazilian vocabulary, the word caipirinha is mostly associated with the drink itself rather than the class of person.

            imagine a cross between a Mojito and a Classic Daiquiri, though with a bit more presence.
            If you want to make a Caipirinha, you'll need to buy some cachaca.
            Cachaca is made from cane sugar.
            Making this cocktail requires muddling sugar with lime wedges.
            Balancing the amount of sugar in this drink is tricky.
            Cachaca has a sweetish (almost fruity) and herbal flavor with a slight aftertaste that reminds me a bit of tequila.
            It's a tad harsh, so I wouldn't want to drink the white version neat or on the rocks
            The Caipirinha takes quite well to experimentation, so it's a drink you can play with a bit.
            So feel free to add more lime if you find that the amount specified in the recipe isn't sufficient.
            Some people say raw sugar is traditional in this drink, while others insist on white cane sugar.
            this drink is pretty close in spirit to the Mojito - you could even add mint to it, if you wanted
            We drink caipis here (buenos aires) like it's the end of the world.
            This does look like a very summery drink but it sure is difficult to pronounce and spell.
            I have memories popping up of drinking this on a holiday in Brazil some years ago, and I do remember it being quite addictive.
            I usually use ice cubes, but crushed ice is great in this drink, too.
            And you're right that it's so wonderful for summer!
            Sweet and citrus... I'm thirsty!
            What a simple little drink and I love the touch of sweetness.

            well, maybe 2 sips. ;-) Great tasting drink, though.

    <cocktail name="Mint Julep">
        <prime>whiskey</prime>
        <description>
            The mint julep is a mixed alcoholic drink, or cocktail, consisting primarily of bourbon (or some other spirit), water, crushed or shaved ice, and fresh mint.
            As a bourbon-based cocktail, it is associated with the American South and the cuisine of the Southern United States in general, and the Kentucky Derby in particular.
            The Kentucky Derby is among the most famous horse races in the US (and part of the Triple Crown Series that also includes the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes).
            Traditionally held the first Saturday in May, it's the first big US race of the season.
            This ice cold cocktail traditionally is served in a silver cup -- which the imbiber holds by the bottom and top edges in order not to disturb the frosty coating of condensation that develops on the outside.
        </description>
        <history>
            The origins of the mint julep are clouded and may never be definitively known.
            It originated in the southern United States, probably during the eighteenth century.
            U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky introduced the drink to Washington, D.C., at the Round Robin Bar in the famous Willard Hotel during his residence in the city.
            The term "julep" is generally defined as a sweet drink, particularly one used as a vehicle for medicine.
            The word itself is derived from the Persian word Golab, meaning rose water.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            Well, usually we muddle mint at the bottom of the serving glass (typically with some sugar) before adding ice and liquor.  Doing so releases the mint's volatile oils, and thus helps flavor the drink.
            We tend to associate whiskey (specifically bourbon) with juleps, but you can use any liquor.
            Most recipes for Mint Juleps include a lot of booze -- typically 3 or 4 ounces of bourbon.
            Consider making mint-flavored simple syrup for this drink -- you'll get much more mint flavor than the standard recipe produces.
        </trivia>

            Add a good handful of mint and stir frequently until the mixture just comes to a simmer.
            Granulated sugar that fails to dissolve completely can make drinks somewhat gritty.
            The idea is that you'll poke your nose into the garnish as you sip your drink, which allows you to inhale some of the mint aroma.
            In fact, they probably weren't made that way until the late 1700s (when bourbon became known as, well, bourbon).
            Before that time, rum (dark) was probably the spirit of choice, although Regan reports that both peach brandy and regular brandy were common in early forms of the drink.
            Mint Juleps are a natural when warm weather arrives, so it's not surprising that they have become linked to late-spring and summer events.
            Spring is a good time for horse racing carnival.
            Hi Sue, the frosted silver mugs do look pretty.
            I want mine in a silver cup.
            And to think I am always pulling spearmint to stop it from taking over my garden!
            the dominating flavor is bourbon, sweetness next (from the sugar), and mint last.

        <description>
            The Mai Tai is an alcoholic cocktail based on rum, Curacao liqueur, and lime juice, associated with Polynesian-style settings.
            The Mai Tai is perfect as a summer cocktail: sultry, yet cooling and refreshing at the same time.
            So, lest you harbor suspicions about the Mai Tai because of its parasol persuasion, let me hasten to add that this is arguably one of the world's top ten drinks.
            A real Mai Tai contains just a few ingredients.
            But ingredient quality is important in this drink, so choosing the proper ones is an important consideration, as we'll discuss in the notes.
        </description>
        <history>
            It is said to have been invented by the proprietor of Trader Vic's of Oakland, California in 1944.
            He created the drink for some friends who were visiting from Tahiti and after one of them exclaimed that the drink was "Maita'i", or very good in Tahitian, the name stuck.
            A rival restaurant, Don the Beachcomber, also claims to have invented the cocktail in 1933 with a more complex version of the drink.
            The truth probably lies somewhere in between, but California was more than likely the birthplace of the popular cocktail.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            It's impossible to duplicate Trader Vic's original Mai Tai because he used 17-year-old Wray &amp; Nephew rum, which is no longer available.
            The Mai Tai was also prominently featured in the Elvis Presley film Blue Hawaii.
            Today, the Mai Tai is synonymous with Tiki culture both past and present.
            Richard M. Nixon also hit his high point in the 1950's and 60's, and then disappeared (so to speak) during the 70's.
            So it's fitting that the Mai Tai was his favorite cocktail.

            The umbrella is optional, but a cocktail straw makes it more enjoyable.
            The higher quality the rum, the better this drink tastes.
            Jamaican rums are ideal in a Mai Tai.
            The Mai Tai requires Orgeat syrup, a sweet syrup flavored with almonds and orange or rose water.

            Speaking of straws, that's the one garnish I think is necessary to this drink.
            Common garnishes for the Mai Tai include lime wedges, an empty lime shell half (just chuck it into the glass for a nice spot of color), pineapple wedges, maraschino cherries, mint sprigs -- and of course umbrellas.
            And if you happen to have some tiki mugs lurking somewhere in your cupboard -- well, haul them out to serve this drink.

    <cocktail name="Mojito">
        <prime>rum</prime>
        <description>
            Mojito is a traditional Cuban highball.
            This refreshing cocktail packs a lot of flavor and pleasure into each tall, cool glass.
            So it makes an excellent thirst quencher for a long, hot summer afternoon.
            You can have two -- and still keep your wits about you.
            Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, sparkling water, and mint.
            The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on the island.
            Its combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the potent kick of the rum, and has made this clear highball a popular summer drink.
            The cocktail has a relatively low alcohol content (about 10 percent alcohol by volume).
        </description>
        <history>
            Havana is the birthplace of the Mojito, although the exact origin of this classic cocktail is the subject of debate.
            One story traces the Mojito to a similar 16th century drink known as "El Draque", after Francis Drake.
            In 1586, after his successful raid at Cartagena de Indias Drake's ships sailed towards Havana but there was an epidemic of dysentery and scurvy on board.
            It was known that the local South American Indians had remedies for various tropical illnesses; so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for a medicine which was effective.
            The ingredients were aguardiente de cana (a crude form of rum, translates as fire water from sugar cane) added with local tropical ingredients; lime, sugarcane juice and mint.
            Drinking lime juice in itself would have been a great help in staving off scurvy and dysentery.
            Tafia / Rum was used as soon as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650).
            While this drink was not called a Mojito at this time, it was still the original combination of these ingredients.
            Several other stories exist regarding the cocktail's true origins, but most stories simply provide evidence to how long the general recipe has been in existence.
            The great author, Ernest Hemingway, was known to have developed quite a taste for the refreshing drink.

            It's also exceptionally easy to make.
            Traditionally, you make this drink in a glass.
            That is, you add all the ingredients to the glass and stir them with a spoon
            For this drink, you should use a tall glass that holds 10 to 14 ounces (12 is ideal).
            This recipe yields one drink, and takes about 5 minutes to prepare.
            It's easy to scale up if you're serving thirsty hordes.
            Some people like to add the empty shell of a lime half (one that you squeezed for juice) to the bottom of the glass as additional garnish.
            Gorgeous day, sitting in the sand outside a beach hut bar on the Bay of Pigs and the barman asks if I'd like a mojito.

            We love the fresh, clean flavor.
            Lime, rum, and sugar.
            this drink is more refreshing than thirst quenching
            The Mojito is a fantastic drink if you are undecided when ordering something from the bar.
            When preparing a mojito, lime juice is added to sugar (or syrup) and mint leaves.
            The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler.
            The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded.
            Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation.
            Finally, the drink is topped with whole ice cubes and sparkling soda water.
            Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.

            A Bloody Mary is a popular cocktail containing vodka, tomato juice, and combinations of other spices and flavorings including Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, piri piri sauce, beef consommé or bouillon, horseradish, celery, olives, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and celery salt.
            It has been called "the world's most complex cocktail".
        </description>
        <history>
            The Bloody Mary's origin is unclear, and there are multiple conflicting claims of who invented the Bloody Mary.
            Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary in 1921, well before any of the later claims.
            He was working at the New York Bar in Paris at the time, which later became Harry's New York Bar
        </history>
        <trivia>
            The Bloody Mary is famed as a "hair of the dog" remedy (meaning that if you consume too much alcohol the night before, it's supposed to help assuage your pain the next morning).
            The name "Bloody Mary" is associated with a number of historical figures -- particularly Queen Mary I of England, who was nicknamed as such in Foxe's Book of Martyrs for attempting to re-establish the Catholic Church in England -- and fictional women from folklore.
            Some drink aficionados believe the inspiration for the name was Hollywood star Mary Pickford.
            Others trace the name to a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood.
            However, another argument for the origin of "Bloody Mary", that the name in English simply arose from "a failure to pronounce the Slav syllables of a drink called Vladimir" gains some credibility from the observation that the customer at Harry's Bar in Paris for whom Fernand Petiot prepared the drink in 1920 was Vladimir Smirnov, of the Smirnoff vodka family.
            A Bloody Mary is usually served on-the-rocks in an old-fashioned glass or in a tall (Collins) glass.
            For a drink that's about 75 percent tomato juice and 20 percent alcohol, people have surprisingly strong opinions about what goes in that last 5%.

            The cocktail's prominence in the film has been connected to a revival in its popularity.

            Like liquid ice cream
            The key character in that movie -- a slacker known as The Dude -- drinks them often.
            With its mix of vodka, Kahlua, and sweet cream, the drink tastes like boozy ice cream.
            The Big Lebowski was written, produced, and directed by the Coen brothers -- Joel and Ethan.
            The Dude (played by Jeff Bridges) is an unemployed slacker living in Los Angeles.
            Other than drinking White Russians, his chief interests are bowling and hanging out.
            The Dude refers to White Russian Cocktails as "Caucasians."
            "Careful, Man, There's a Beverage Here"
            "They bowl, too," said Mrs K R. "In fact, part of the event takes place in a bowling alley."
            I think I prefer the White Russian to them all because it is smooth and creamy and oh so delicious.
            Yes indeed, heavy in calories but oh so worth it!
            Drinkable desserts are fun-- and the boozy ones are a party in the mouth.
            It WAS like drinking melted ice cream --- what a terrific throw back recipe
            Vodka, Kahlua, and sweet cream and the drink tastes like boozy ice cream!
            this creamy, dreamy good cocktail is so delicious...
            They really were delicious milkshakes.
            This seems like a sweet tasty drink.

        <prime>liquid nitrogen</prime>
        <description>
            A liquid nitrogen cocktail is any mixed drink whose preparation involves the use of liquid nitrogen.
            Popularized as a novelty because of the smoky, bubbling "cauldron effect" it produces, liquid nitrogen is controversial as a cocktail ingredient because it boils at -196 °C (77 K; -321 °F) and its consumption is thus potentially lethal.
            Because of its low temperature liquid nitrogen can be extremely damaging to body tissue, causing frostbite and cryogenic burning on contact.
            If ingested it can lead to severe internal damage, destroying tissue in the mouth and digestive tract.
            Furthermore, as it evaporates liquid nitrogen releases a large volume of gas, which means it can burst the stomach if swallowed in a sufficiently large amount.
            However, it is not a regulated substance in most countries and there is little control of its use.
        </description>
        <history>
            The culinary use of liquid nitrogen is mentioned in an 1890 recipe book titled Fancy Ices authored by Mrs. Agnes Marshall, but has been employed in more recent times by restaurants in the preparation of frozen desserts, such as ice cream, which can be created within moments at the table because of the speed at which it cools food.
            Similarly, liquid nitrogen has become popular in the preparation of cocktails because it can be used to quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients.
            It is also added to drinks to create a smoky effect, which occurs as tiny droplets of the liquid nitrogen come into contact with the surrounding air, condensing the vapour that is naturally present.

        <description>
            Tequila is a strong distilled alcoholic beverage produced from fermented Agave plant, made primarily in the area surrounding Tequila, a town in the western Mexican state of Jalisco, 50 km from Guadalajara. 
            It is made from the agave plant (also called maguey) - a succulent, similar to the lily, which is native to Mexico.
        </description>
        <history>
            Tequila was first produced in the 16th century near the location of the city of Tequila which was not officially established until 1656. 
            The Aztec peoples had previously made a fermented beverage from the agave plant which they called octli (later, and more popularly called pulque), long before the Spanish arrived in 1521. 
            When the Spanish conquistadors ran out of their own brandy, they began to distill this agave drink to produce North America's first indigenous distilled spirit.
            Some 80 years later, around 1600, Don Pedro Sánchez de Tagle, the Marquis of Altamira, began mass-producing tequila at the first factory in the territory of modern-day Jalisco. 
            By 1608, the colonial governor of Nueva Galicia had begun to tax his products.
            The tequila that is popular today was first mass-produced in the early 1800s in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
            1800 Tequila (tm) is marketed today in commemoration of the year in which the first successfully aged Tequila was produced. 
            Several large batches of Tequila produced in 1800 (although not of the original single batch) have survived the test of time and are marketed today for commercial consumption. 
            This premium Tequila is a tribute to the earliest master Tequila blenders.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            Tequila is usually bottled in one of four categories: 
                * plata or blanca ("silver" – aged no more than a couple of months)
                * oro or joven abocado ("gold" or "bottled when young" – "silver" tequila colored to resemble aged tequila)
                * reposado ("rested" – aged about a year)
                * añejo ("aged" or "vintage" – aged from 1 to 3 years)
            The aging process changes the color of tequila, but the liquid can sometimes be colored with caramel to show a darker color, indicative of a longer aging process; añejos tend to be darker, the reposados slightly less dark, while the platas are not colored at all.
            It is a common misconception among foreigners (as well as some natives!) that some tequilas contain a 'worm' in the bottle. Only certain mezcals, usually from the state of Oaxaca, are ever sold con gusano, and that only began as a marketing gimmick in the 1940s. 
            The worm is actually the larval form of the moth Hipopta agavis that lives on the agave plant. 
            Finding one in the plant during processing indicates an infestation and, correspondingly, a lower quality product. 
            However this misconception continues, and even with all the effort and marking to represent Tequila as a premium product similar in the way Cognac is seen to Brandy, there are some opportunist producers for the shooters and fun market who will help blur these boundaries.

        <prime>vodka</prime>
        <description>Vodka is a typically colourless liquor, usually distilled from fermented grain or potatoes.
            Except for insignificant amounts of flavorings, vodka consists of water and alcohol (ethanol). 
            Vodka usually has an alcohol content ranging from 35% to 70% by volume ("Vodka Rassputin"). 
            The classic Russian vodka is 40% (80 degrees proof), the number being attributed to the famous Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. 
            According to the Vodka Museum in St.Petersburg, Russia, Mendeleev thought the perfect percentage to be 38, but since spirits in his time were taxed on their strength the percentage was rounded up to 40 to simplify the tax computation.
        </description>
        <history>
            The origins of vodka (and of its name) cannot be traced definitively, but it is believed to have originated in the grain-growing region that now embraces Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and western Russia. It also has a long tradition in Scandinavia.
            Little is known about the early history of the drink in Europe. 
            The first written record of vodka in Poland dates from 1405 in the Sandomierz Court Registry. 
            In Russia, the first written usage of the word vodka in an official document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Catherine I of June 8, 1751 that regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries.
            Another possible origin of the word can be found in the Novgorod chronicle in records dated 1533, where the term "vodka" is used in the context of herbal alcoholic tinctures. A number of pharmaceutical lists contain the terms "vodka of bread wine" (водка хлебного вина) and "vodka in half of bread wine" (водка вполу хлебного вина). 
            As alcohol had long been used as a basis for medicines, this implies that the term vodka is a noun derived from the verb "vodit,'" "razvodit'" ("водить", "разводить"), "to dilute with water." 
            Hence "vodka of bread wine" would be a water dilution of a distilled spirit .
            While the word could be found in manuscripts and in lubok (лубок, pictures with text explaining the plot, a Russian predecessor of the comic), it began to appear in Russian dictionaries in the mid-19th century.
            Vodka is now one of the world's most popular spirits. It was rarely drunk outside Europe before the 1950s, but its popularity spread to the New World by way of post-war France. 
            (Pablo Picasso once defined the most notable features of post-war France as "Brigitte Bardot, modern jazz, Polish vodka.") 
            By 1975 vodka sales in the United States overtook those of bourbon whiskey, previously the most popular hard liquor. 
            In the second half of the 20th century, vodka owed its popularity in part to its reputation as an alcoholic beverage that "leaves you breathless," as one ad put it — no smell of liquor remaining detectable on the breath.
            According to The Penguin Book of Spirits and Liqueurs, "Its low level of fusel oils and congenerics — impurities that flavor spirits but that can contribute to the after-effects of heavy consumption — led to its being considered among the 'safer' spirits, though not in terms of its powers of intoxication, which, depending on strength, may be considerable." 
            Interestingly, other peoples in the area of vodka's probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning "to burn": (Polish: gorzałka; Ukrainian: горілка, horilka; Belarusian: гарэлка, harelka; Lithuanian: degtinė).
            The second half of the 1970s witnessed two massive attacks on the priority and rights of the Soviet Union to market liquors named "vodka".
            The first assault was along the lines that the Russian Revolution "discontinued" Russia's trademark for vodka, which was "naturally" transferred to emigrated manufacturers of vodka, Smirnoff in particular, because of prohibition by Soviets, so that officially the Soviet Union started manufacturing vodka in 1923. 
            This was refuted fairly easily. 
            The second assault, around 1977, by Poland, was more serious, and the Soviet Union undertook the historical research to substantiate Russia's priority, which was completed by 1979, and in 1982 the international arbitrage considered it convincing enough to grant the USSR the priority in vodka as Russian original alcoholic beverage and recognised the Soviet trademark motto "Only vodka from Russia is genuine Russian vodka".
            The author of the research published his findings under the alias William Pokhlebkin in the book A History of Vodka (see references below). 
            Despite the clear bias of the exposition in the book towards the goal (to prove the Russian priority), it is a serious, substantiated research and reveals quite a few facts, as well as debunks a number of myths, on the origins of vodka, both as product and as name.
        </history>
        <trivia>
            Among grain vodkas, rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior. 
            Some vodka is made from potatoes, molasses, soybeans, grapes and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. 
            In some Central European countries like Poland some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and some salts for the yeast and distilling this after a few weeks. 
            Today vodka is produced throughout the world, see List of vodkas. 
            A common property of all vodkas, compared to other spirits, is that before any flavouring is added, they are neutralized as far as possible. 
            This is often done by filtering it in a column still during distillation, and by filtering through charcoal and other media after distillation. 
            The idea is to remove everything except pure water and pure alcohol from the liquid. 
            As a result, vodka has a very neutral taste. 
            Apart from the alcoholic content, vodkas may be classified into two main groups: clear vodkas and flavored vodkas. 
            Due to the high alcohol content of certain brands of vodka, it can be stored in ice or a freezer without any crystalization of water. 
            While most vodkas are unflavored, a wide variety of flavored vodkas has long been produced in traditional vodka-drinking areas, often as homemade recipes to improve vodka's taste, or for medicinal purposes. 
            Flavorings include red pepper, ginger, various fruit flavors, vanilla, chocolate (without sweetener), and cinnamon. 
            Ukrainian produce a commercial vodka that includes St John's Wort. 
            Poles and Belarusians add the leaves of the local bison grass to produce Żubrówka vodka, with slightly sweet flavor and light amber color. 
            In Ukraine and Russia, vodka flavoured with honey and pepper (Pertsovka, in Russian, Pertsivka, in Ukrainian) is also very popular. 
            This tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the Nordic countries, where vodka seasoned with various herbs, fruits and spices is the appropriate strong drink for all traditional seasonal festivities, midsummer in particular. 
            In Sweden alone there are some forty-odd common varieties of herb-flavored vodka (kryddat brännvin). 
            In Poland there is a separate category, nalewka, for vodka-based spirits with fruit, root, flower, or herb extracts, which are often homemade or produced commercially by small distilleries. 
            Its alcohol content may vary from 15 to 75%. 
            The Poles also make a very pure (95%, 190 proof) rectified spirit (Polish language: spirytus rektyfikowany), which is used in a variety of ways. 
            Technically a form of vodka, it is sold in liquor stores, not pharmacies. 
            Similarly, the German market often carries German-/Hungarian-/Polish-/Ukrainian- made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95% alcohol content (as well as straw rum of the same potency). 
            Commonly available flavored vodka brands include Stolichnaya, Absolut and Smirnoff.

            Rum is a distilled beverage made from sugarcane by-products such as molasses and sugarcane juice by a process of fermentation and distillation. 
            The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak and other casks. 
            While there are rum producers in places such as Australia, India, Reunion Island, and elsewhere around the world, the majority of rum production occurs in and around the Caribbean and along the Demerara river in South America. 
            Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies, and has famous associations with the British Royal Navy and piracy. 
        </description>
        <history>
            The origin of the word rum is unclear. 
            A common claim is that the name was derived from rumbullion meaning "a great tumult or uproar". 
            Another claim is the name is from the large drinking glasses used by Dutch seamen known as rummers, from the Dutch word roemer, a drinking glass. 
            Other options include contractions of the words saccharum, Latin for sugar, or arôme, French for aroma. 
            The precursors to rum date back to antiquity. 
            Development of fermented drinks produced from sugarcane juice is believed to have first occurred either in ancient India or China, and spread from there. 
            An example of such an early drink is brum. 
            Produced by the Malay people, brum dates back thousands of years. 
            The first distillation of rum took place on the sugarcane plantations of the Caribbean in the 1600s. 
            Plantation slaves first discovered that molasses, a by-product of the sugar refining process, fermented into alcohol. 
            Later, distillation of these alcoholic by-products concentrated the alcohol and removed impurities, producing the first true rums. 
            Richard Ligon wrote in 1647 that slaves on plantations on Barbados would consume kill-devil; he described it as a "hot, hellish and terrible liquor". 
        </history>

            The grades and variations used to describe rum depend on the location that a rum was produced. 
            Despite these variations the following terms are frequently used to describe various types of rum: Light Rums, also referred to as light, silver, and white rums. 
            In general, light rum has very little flavor aside from a general sweetness, and serves accordingly as a base for cocktails. 
            Light rums are sometimes filtered after aging to remove any color. 
            Gold Rums, also called amber rums, are medium-bodied rums which are generally aged. 
            The rum can obtain its flavor through addition of spices and caramel/color (a variation often sold as Spiced Rum), but historically gains its darker color from aging in wooden casks (typically oak). 
            Dark Rum, also known as black rum, classes as a grade darker than gold rum. 
            It is generally aged longer, in heavily charred barrels. 
            Dark rum has a much stronger flavor than either light or gold rum, and hints of spices can be detected, along with a strong molasses or caramel overtone. 
            It is used to provide substance in rum drinks, as well as color. 
            In addition to uses in mixed drinks, dark rum is the type of rum most commonly used in cooking. 
            Flavored Rum: Some manufacturers have begun to sell rums which they have infused with flavors of spices or of fruits such as mango, orange, citrus, coconut, and lime. 
            These serve to flavour similarly themed tropical drinks which generally comprise less than 40% abv. 
            Examples include Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Parrot Bay Coconut Rum and Redrum. 
            Overproof Rum is rum which is much higher than the standard 40% alcohol. 
            Most of these rums bear greater than 75%, in fact, and preparations of 151 to 160 proof occur commonly. 
            Premium Rum: As with other sipping spirits, such as Cognac and Scotch, a market exists for premium and super-premium spirits. 
            These are generally boutique brands which sell very aged and carefully produced rums.

            Fermentation Sugarcane is harvested to make sugarcane juice and molasses. 
            Most rum is produced from molasses. 
            Within the Caribbean, much of this molasses is from Brazil. 
            A notable exception is the French-speaking islands where sugarcane juice is the preferred base ingredient. 
            To the base ingredient yeast, and potentially water, are added to start fermentation. 
            While some rum producers allow wild yeast to perform the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time. 
            Dunder, the yeast-rich foam from previous fermentations, is the traditional yeast source in Jamaica. 
            “The yeast employed will determine the final taste and aroma profile," says Jamaican master blender Joy Spence. 
            Distillers that make lighter rums, such as Bacardi, prefer to use faster-working yeasts. 
            Use of slower-working yeasts causes more esters to accumulate during fermentation, allowing for a fuller-tasting rum. 
            Distillation As with all other aspects of rum production, there is no standard method used for distillation. 
            While some producers work in batches using pot stills, most rum production is done using column still distillation.

            Gin is an distilled alcoholic spirit. 
            The most common style of gin is "London dry gin", which refers not to brand, or origin, but to a distillation process. 
            London dry gin is a high proof spirit, usually produced in a column still and redistilled after the botanicals are added to the base spirit. 
            In addition to juniper, it is usually made with a small amount citrus botanicals like lemon and bitter orange peel.

        <history>
            Gin originated in the Netherlands in the 17th century - its invention is often credited to the physician Franciscus Sylvius. 
            From there it spread to England after the Glorious Revolution put a Dutchman on the English throne. 
            Dutch gin, known as jenever, is a distinctly different drink from English-style gin; it is distilled with barley and sometimes aged in wood, giving it a slight resemblance to whisky. 
            Schiedam, in South Holland, is famous for its jenever. 
            Jenever is produced in a pot still and is more strongly flavored than London gin. 
            Gin became very popular in England after the government created a market for poor quality grain that was unfit to be used in brewing beer by allowing unlicensed gin production and at the same time imposing a heavy duty on all imported spirits. 
            Thousands of gin-shops sprang up all over England. 
            By 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became extremely popular with the poor. 
            Of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London over half were gin-shops. 
            Beer maintained a healthy reputation as it was often safer to drink the brewed ale than unclean plain water, but gin was blamed for various social and medical problems, and may have been a factor in the high death rate that caused London's previously increasing population to remain stable. 
            The reputation of the two drinks was illustrated by William Hogarth in his engravings Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751). 
            This negative reputation survives today in the English language; terms such as "gin-mills" to describe disreputable bars or calling drunks "gin-soaked". 
            The Gin Act 1736 imposed high taxes on retailers but led to riots in the streets. 
            The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. 
            The Gin Act 1751, however, was more successful. 
            It forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin-shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates.

            Grappa, also known as Grappa Wine, is an Italian grape-based spirit of between 40% and 50% alcohol by volume (80 to 100 proof). 
            It is made from the distillation of pomace (for which one occasionally sees the French word marc), i.e., the residue of grapes (including the stems and seeds) that were pressed for the winemaking process. 
            It was originally made to prevent wastage by using the leftovers at the end of the wine season. 
            It quickly became commercialized, mass-produced, and sold to the world.

            The flavour of grappa, like wine, depends on the type and quality of the grape used. 
            However, many producers have added fruit syrup to sweeten and soften the mix so that it appeals more to the American market. 
            Grappa's taste is very similar to the Balkan's slivovitz. 
            Grappa is frequently served cold and rarely mixed. 
            Sometimes, usually in Italy, grappa is added to espresso and known as a "Caffè Corretto", which can also be made with other alcohols, such as Sambuca. 
            The other variation of this is the "Amazza Caffè"; literally, "to kill the coffee".

            Cognac named after the town of Cognac in France, is a kind of brandy, which must be produced in the region surrounding the town. 
            The wine to be distilled must be made from at least 90 percent Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche or Colombard grapes. 
            The rest of the wine can consist of ten selected grapes. 
            However, most wine is made from Ugni Blanc only. 
            It must be distilled twice in copper pot stills and aged at least 2 1/2 years in oak barrels in order to be called "cognac".

            Cognac is made from eaux-de-vie (literally, "water of life") produced by doubly distilling the white wines produced in any of the growth areas. 
            The wine is a very dry, acidic, thin wine, not really suitable for drinking, but excellent for distillation. 
            It may only be made from a strict list of grape varieties. 
            Distillation takes place in traditionally shaped Charentais copper stills, the design and dimensions of which are also controlled. 
            Two distillations must be carried out; the resulting eau-de-vie is a colourless spirit of about 70 percent alcohol. 
            Cognac may not be sold to the public, or indeed called 'Cognac' until it has been aged for at least two years, counting from the end of the period of distillation (1 April following the year the grapes were harvested). 
            During the aging, a large percentage of the alcohol (and water) in the eaux-de-vie evaporates through the porous oak barrels. 
            This is termed locally the "part des anges", or angels' share, a phrase also used in Scotch Whisky production. 
            A black fungus, Baudoinia compniacensis (Richon) JA Scott and Untereiner (Torula compniacensis Richon), thrives on the alcoholic vapours and normally grows on the walls of the aging cellars. 
            The final product is diluted to 40 percent alcohol content (80 proof). 
            The age of the cognac is shown as that of the youngest eau-de-vie used in the blend. 
            The blend is usually of different ages and from different local areas. 
            This blending, or marriage, of different eaux-de-vie is important to obtain a complexity of flavours absent from an eau-de-vie from a single distillery or vineyard. 
            Each cognac house has a master taster (matre de chai) who is responsible for creating this delicate blend of spirits, so that the cognac produced by a company today will taste exactly the same as a cognac produced by that same company 50 years ago, or in 50 years' time. 
        
            Grades include  VS (Very Special) or *** (three stars), where the youngest brandy is stored at least two years in cask. 
            * VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale), serve, where the youngest brandy is stored at least four years in cask. 
            * XO (Extra Old), Napoleon, Hors d'Age, where the youngest brandy is stored at least seven years in cask. 
            
            Each cognac house also produces its own premium-level cognac. 
            These include: Louis XIII by Remy Martin is composed of more than 1,200 of the finest eaux-de-vie aged between 40 years and a century in very old Limousin oak barrels. 
            Richard Hennessy - produced by Hennessy, 'Richard' is a blend of over 100 eaux-de-vie aged up to 200 years. 
            It is sold in a Baccarrat crystal blackman and is named after the founder of the company. 
            L'Esprit de Courvoisier - Courvoisier's leading cognac, presented in a hand-cut Lalique decanter, blended from eaux-de-vie up to 200 years old, and individually numbered.

        <description>
            Cachaca is the most popular distilled alcoholic beverage in Brazil, made from sugarcane juice (also called garapa). 
            The legal definition of cachaça says "cachaça is the product of the distillation of the fermented sugarcane juice, with alcohol strength between 38% and 51% by volume. 
            Up to 6 gr per liter of sugar can be added". 
            Cachaça is often said to differ from rum in that it made from sugarcane juice while rum is made from molasses. 
            However, a number of rum distillers use sugarcane juice instead of molasses to make their rums, this rum is called "Rhum Agricole". 
            Cachaça is the 3rd most important spirit of the world with 1.3 billion liters produced each year. 
            Only 1.5% of this production is exported (mainly to Portugal, Paraguay and Germany). 
            Outside Brazil, cachaça is used almost exclusively as an ingredient in tropical drinks, caipirinha being the most famous. 
        </description>
        <history>
            Cachaça was invented by the first Portuguese settlers of Brazil, in the region around the town of São Vicente, sometime between 1532 and 1548. 
            Workers at local sugar mills first discovered that the sugarcane juice (garapa), cooked and left standing, would "sour" (ferment) and turn into a mild alcoholic beverage. 
            The product, disparagingly named cagaça, was consumed by slaves, as a cheap substitute for the Indians' cauim. 
            Soon someone had the idea of distilling it, and thus cachaça was born. 
            Cachaça distilleries multiplied through colonial Brazil during the 16th and 17th centuries. 
            Portugal eventually took notice and, in order to protect the market for Portuguese-made grappa (bagaceira), tried several times to outlaw the manufacture and consumption of the new spirit. 
            In 1756, after a century of failure to suppress it, the Crown gave up and levied a tax on cachaça. 
            This tax brought substantial revenue to the Treasury, and contributed to the reconstruction of Lisbon, which had been just devastated by an earthquake followed by a tsunami (1755 Lisbon earthquake). 
            Currently there are more than 4,000 different brands of cachaça available in Brazil. 
            Early in its history it was consumed mainly by Africans, peasants, and members of the lower class. 
            As is often the case, elitists considered it a low drink, unfit for exclusivist bars and tables. 
            However, the finer points of the product gained wider and wider appreciation, and it is now a very popular drink, considered by some to be in the same class as whiskey and wine. 
            The most prized brands are produced in São Paulo, Ceará, Pernambuco, and Minas Gerais. 
        </history>
        <trivia>
            There are two types of cachaça: artisanal and industrial. 
            Artisanal cachaças are produced by thousands of small mills spread all over the country, with Minas Gerais's state respected as the best source. 
            Traditionally, the fermentation agent is a maize flour called "fubá" and the distillation unit is a copper pot still. 
            The cachaça comes from the pot stills in 3 batches: "head", "core" and "tail". 
            Most of the makers take only the "core", discarding the other two which have undesirable components. 
            Then the cachaça is either bottled or stored in wood barrels for ageing. 
            The cachaça is aged in barrels made from a great variety of native or exotic trees such as chestnut, umburana, jequitibá, ipê, grápia, balsam wood, almond, jatobá, guanandi, brazilwood, cabreúva, tibiriçá, garapeira, cherry, and oak. 
            Makers of artesanal cachaça usually bottle their own product, selling directly to the market (consumers, bars, restaurants, supermarkets, etc.). 
            Domestically, artisanal cachaças are mostly drunk straight by consumers from the higher economic classes of society. 
            Industrial cachaças are made by medium-sized and big mills mostly located in the countryside of the São Paulo and Ceará states. 
            The industrial cachaça makers use column stills to process the fermented sugarcane juice ("continuous distillation process"). 
            The product is then sold as a raw material to cachaça bottlers such as "51", "Velho Barreiro", "Tatuzinho", "Pitu", "21", "Colonial". 
            The bottlers adjust the cachaças to their standards by adding or removing components. 
            Most of the time, industrial cachaças are not aged, being drunk straight by the lower economic classes.

        <description>
            From Medieval Latin aqua vitae, "water of life", also spelled aquavite, or akvavit, also called snaps in Denmark. 
            A Scandinavian flavoured, distilled liquor, ranging in alcohol content from about 42 to 45 percent by volume, clear to pale yellow in colour, distilled from a fermented potato or grain mash, flavored with caraway seeds or cumin seed, others that may be used are lemon or orange peel, cardamom, aniseed, and fennel. 
            Like vodka, Aquavit is distilled from potato or grain. 
            It is flavoured with herbs such as caraway seeds, anise, dill, fennel, coriander, and grains of paradise, among others. 
            The recipe differs between the different brands, but typically caraway is the dominating flavour. 
            Aquavit usually has a yellowish brown hue, but is available in many other shades of brown, depending on the amount of time it has been aged in oak barrels. 
            Normally, darker colour suggests higher age or the use of young casks, but this may also come from the use of artificial colour (caramel - E150). 
        </description>
        <history>
            The earliest known reference to Akvavit is to be found in a 1531 letter from the Danish Lord of Bergenshus castle, Eske Bille to Olav Engelbretsson, the last Archbishop of Norway. 
            The letter, accompanying a package, offers the archbishop "some water which is called Aqua Vite and is a help for all sort of sickness which a man can have both internally and externally." According to Alcohol Aficionado's History of Aquavit, Archbishop Engelbretsson went on to introduce the Norwegian public to the strong form of aquavit that exists today. 
            While this claim for the medicinal properties of the drink may be rather inflated, it is a popular belief that aquavit will ease the digestion of rich foods. 
            In Norway it is particularly drunk at celebrations, such as Christmas or May 17 (Norwegian Constitution Day). 
            In Sweden it is a staple of the traditional midsummer celebrations dinner, usually drunk while singing one of many drinking songs. 
            It is usually drunk as a snaps during meals, especially during the appetizer course— along with pickled herring, crayfish, lutefisk or smoked fish. 
            In this regard it is popularly quipped that akvavit helps the fish swim down to the stomach. 
            It is also a regular on the traditional Norwegian Christmas meals, including roasted rib of pork and stickmeat (Pinnekjøtt).

            Among the most important brands are Gilde and Løiten from Norway, Aalborg from Denmark and Skåne and O.P Andersson from Sweden. 
            While the Danish and Swedish variants are normally very light in colour, most of the Norwegian brands are matured in oak casks for at least one year and for some brands even as long as 12 years. 
            While members of all three nations can be found to claim that "their" style of Akvavit is the best as a matter of national pride, Norwegian Akevitt tend to have, if not the most distinctive character, then at least the most overpowering flavour and deepest colour due to the aging process. 
            Particular to the Norwegian tradition is the occurrence of Linie akvavits (such as "Løiten Linie" and "Lysholm Linie"). 
            These have been carried in oak casks onboard ships crossing the equator ("Linie") twice before it is sold. 
            While many experts claim that this tradition is little more than a gimmick, some argue that the moving seas and frequent temperature changes cause the spirit to extract more flavour from the casks. 
            Norwegian akvavit distillers Arcus has carried out a scientific test where they tried to emulate the rocking of the casks aboard the "Linie" ships while the casks were subjected to the weather elements as they would aboard the same ship.

            There are several methods of drinking aquavit. 
            It is surprisingly often shot a glass at a time, and although this is usually attributed to tradition, it is suspected that it has something to do with the fact that some people have problems with the spirit's special taste. 
            Aquavit connoisseurs, on the other hand, tend to treat akvavit like fine whisky, sipping slowly away and delving into flavours and aromas.
            Aquavit arguably complements beer better than many other spirits, and in a drinking situation, any quantity of aquavit is usually preceded (or succeeded) by a swig of beer. 
            Enthusiasts generally lament this practice, claiming that the beer will ruin the delicately balanced flavour and aftertaste.
